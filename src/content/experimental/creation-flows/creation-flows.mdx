### Creating is the generation of a new resource. Relocating an existing resource is adding, not creating.

## Standard creation

The standard creation pattern is used when no stepped guidance is needed and the input fields are directly related to each other.

### Modal

If there are only one or two decisions to be made during a creation, use a small, standard modal overlaying the content where the creation was initiated. Avoid scrolling inside a small modal.

### Side panel

If you have limited screen real estate, consider using a side panel. Side panels also keep the user aware of the context in which they were working. You may choose to use either the slide in or slide over panels.

### Full page

If your creation flow consists of multiple fields and/or supporting imagery, consider the full page option. Full page creation flows allow you to take advantage of maximum screen real estate.

#### Buttion position

When the full page dialog is viewed in mobile, the buttons are positioned at the bottom of the screen.

</ImageComponent>

On a larger screen it is recommended that buttons always remain visible to the user.

When there are enough fields going beyond the fold, buttons should be located in the top right and should stick upon scrolling. If only a couple are present, buttons can be placed on the left below the last field. 


<Row>
<Column offsetLg="4" colMd="4" colLg="6">
  <DoDontExample label="Buttons should not be hidden below the fold.">

</Column>
<Column colMd="4" colLg="6" >
  <DoDontExample correct label="Buttons are located on the left if they are likely to appear above the fold.">

</Row>

<Column offsetLg="4" colMd="4" colLg="6">
  <DoDontExample correct label="Buttons are located on the right if the amount of content would push them below the fold. They should stick upon scrolling so are always visible.">

</Column>
<Column colMd="4" colLg="6" >
  <DoDontExample correct label="If an illustration or image is displayed on the right then buttons should be displayed above the image.">

</Column>
</Row>

#### Illustration/Image

To include a supporting image, place it on the right hand side of the window. 

<ImageComponent caption="Example of advanced option" cols="12">

</ImageComponent>


#### Advanced Option

The advanced option is used to avoid overwhelming users, whilst allowing advanced users to access everything. It can be applied to the side panel and the full page dialog.

Consider by default having a minimal set of options visible, with the ability for the user to chose if they want to expose more ‘advanced’ options.

If the user switches to advanced mode, ideally remember this for when they perform the same task.

## Multistep creation

If the creation task is complex, consider breaking the process up into multiple steps. Display related or dependant options together. 

Multistep creation follows the same principles as Standard creation, with the addition of multisteps.

### Confirmation

When any create action is a success, a notification banner can be presented to visually confirm this.
